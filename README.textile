h1. odkbuild â€” wysiwyg web-based xforms editor for the odk subset

h2. Usage

odkbuild (formerly odkmaker) is a web-based service. Unless you mean to do development on it, just go to http://build.opendatakit.org to give it a try.

h2. Development

odkbuild is a Ruby Rack-based application. Everything it needs is kicked off by the config.ru Rackup file. We use @shotgun@ for local development and Phusion Passenger for staging and production deployment.

h3. Dependencies

The project has one native dependency: Tokyo Cabinet. We use this as our datastore. You'll have to build it natively for any system you want to run the server on. See http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/ for details.

Once you have that, all Rubygem dependencies are managed by Ruby Bundler. Make sure you have at least version 1.0.0 of Bundler installed (@gem update --system && gem install bundler@ if you don't have it already), and then simply run @bundle install@ in the application root to resolve and install the appropriate dependencies.

h3. Setup and Execution

Now that you have resolved all the appropriate dependencies, you'll need to set up the configuration by copying @config.yml.sample@ to @config.yml@. This file contains a number of secret keys and tokens, so be sure not to check it into source control once you put your own keys into it. Finally, you'll want to run @rackup config.ru@ to start the server, or @shotgun config.ru@ if you want the application to automatically detect your changes to source code and load them up when you refresh the app in your web browser.

If you're running Build in a production environment, there are a couple of things that the application needs to build before it will run. Before first-run, and after each time you update with a new version, you'll want to run @rake deploy:build@. This will bundle all the assets the application needs for speed an ease of deployment.
