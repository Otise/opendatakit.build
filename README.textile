h1. odkbuild â€” wysiwyg web-based xforms editor for the odk subset

h2. Usage

odkbuild (formerly odkmaker) is a web-based service. Unless you mean to do development on it, just go to http://build.opendatakit.org to give it a try.

h2. Development

odkbuild is a Ruby Rack-based application. Everything it needs is kicked off by the config.ru Rackup file. We use @shotgun@ for local development and Phusion Passenger for production deployment.

h3. Dependencies

The project has one native dependency: Tokyo Cabinet. We use this as our datastore. You'll have to build it natively for any system you want to run the server on. See http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/ for details.

Once you have that, all Rubygem dependencies are managed by Ruby Bundler. Make sure you have at least version 1.0.0 of Bundler installed (@gem update --system && gem install bundler@ if you don't have it already), and then simply run @bundle install@ in the application root to resolve and install the appropriate dependencies.
